# What-is-Agile

1️⃣  Value #1: Individuals and interactions

Successful teams prioritize finding the right people and making sure they communicate frequently. Good tools and processes help, but focusing on the individuals and their interactions will yield the best results.

For example, the world's best guitar is useless to someone that doesn't know how to play it. Making a beautiful song (or product) requires highly skilled people that can collaborate effectively.

Your team should do the same: prioritize people and communicate often. Frequent discussions across the team help uncover critical information to keep the work moving forward.

2️⃣  Value #2: Working software

Successful teams prioritize delivering a product that works. Not to make it perfect. This value applies to any work you deliver to customers, not just software.

Before agile, teams would try to build against the full scope of project requirements, allowing very little flexibility.

Instead, your team should look for a few critical features to deliver as a  Minimum Viable Product  (or MVP). Then, the team should prioritize building the MVP and get it in the customers' hands as quickly as possible.

This practice gives customers a working product. And it allows your team to get real-time feedback to improve future iterations.

3️⃣   Value #3: Customer collaboration

Successful teams prioritize frequent collaboration with stakeholders and customers. Think of your customers as partners, working closely to design the best solution.

Before agile, teams would spend a lot of time detailing a final product before the work started. The problem was that these original details rarely ended up providing much value in the end.

Instead, you should partner closely with your customer throughout the process and be ready to adapt to changing needs and requirements. Gather feedback frequently to help your customers quickly solve their highest priority problems.

4️⃣  Value #4: Responding to change

Successful teams stay flexible and ready to adapt to unforeseen changes. Starting with a plan is always a good idea. But don't be overly rigid in sticking to it.

It's important to recognize in work (and life) that change is the only constant. Markets, teams, projects, and situations are constantly in flux. 

You and your team will be most successful if you prepare your mind for constant changes, and be ready to make intelligent pivots on a whim.

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

✅   1.  Show respect for all team members

Healthy, high-performing teams create a culture of trust and mutual respect. That's the backbone of agility. 

Having an agile mindset means you embrace different ways of thinking and working, even if you don't always agree with them. Focus on keeping an open mind and seeking to understand new and unexpected ideas.

✅   2.  Communicate openly and clearly

Share updates. Ask questions. Be open and transparent at all times. With each interaction, challenge yourself to communicate clearly and concisely. 

Encourage your team to engage in frequent discussions. Quality discussions can reveal critical information that moves the work forward and helps the team feel more connected.

✅  3.  Look for ways to innovate

Agility is all about delivering maximum value to customers. When a customer's needs change, you need to respond quickly with an innovative solution.

Having an agile mindset means you're constantly looking for opportunities to innovate. This could mean improving your team's internal processes. Or enhancing features of the product you're building.

As you complete your daily tasks, think if there are ways to improve what you're doing. Analyzing and improving your team's work will be valuable for your future career.

✅   4.  Actively improve your skills

Agile is all about continuous improvement. In your daily work, always look for opportunities to learn and grow your skillset.

Pause for a minute and think about your current skills: Which skills seem to be most valuable? Which skills mesh well with your natural tendencies? Use these questions as a starting point to help you plan which skills to sharpen.

Prioritizing your skill development is always a good idea. Not only does it help your team, but it also improves your future career opportunities.

✅   5.  Your work doesn't have to be perfect

Your goal is to deliver something that works; an MVP. Not to make every detail perfect.

Shift your mindset to focus on doing "good enough" work, and then get immediate feedback to improve the next version. Try to adopt this approach for both large and small tasks.

"Good enough" is different for every team and every project. If the parameters are not clear, you may want to discuss them with your team leader.

✅   6.  Have a plan, but always be ready to pivot

An agile mindset is about being flexible and ready for any unpredictable change. Yes, you should always have a Plan A (and B and C, if time allows). But you'll be most successful at work if your mind is always prepared to pivot.

Change will come. It always does. Your job is to prepare your brain to stay calm and collected so that you can handle each emotional wave with ease. If everyone on the team is ready for change, you'll be able to bounce back quickly and refocus energy on solving new problems.
